# MemeMe1.0

This is my rendition of the MemeMe 1.0 project for the iOS Developer nanodegree at [udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com). Meme 1.0 is the mid-course project for the course *UIKit Fundamentals*.

The app enables a user to take a picture and add text at the top and/or bottom of the picture to make a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.
